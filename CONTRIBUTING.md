# Contributing to AIConsole

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AIConsole! We are thrilled to have you join our community and appreciate your help in making this project even better and stronger.

## Code of Conduct
Please review our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a harmonious and respectful environment.

## Contribution Workflow

### Branch Structure
We utilize two main branches:
- `main`: Stable versions of the project are reflected here with releases tagged accordingly.
- `develop`: All ongoing development occurs here. This is where you'll base your work and submit pull requests.

### Starting Work on a Feature or Fix
- For new work, always branch from the `develop` branch.
- Name your branch in a way that reflects your work such as `feature/<feature-name>` or `fix/<issue-being-fixed>`.

### Committing Changes
Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for clarity and consistency in your commit messages. Here are some examples:
- `feat(auth): implement OAuth login`
- `fix(parser): handle edge case with multiline input`
- `docs: add user authentication guide`

These prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) in your commit messages are helpful for automatic versioning and changelog generation.

### Testing Your Code
- We rely mostly on manual testing for now, so please thoroughly check your code before submitting.
- If possible outline the tests you performed in the pull request description, including any relevant details or screenshots.
- If you are adding new functionality, consider adding tests to cover it.

### Pull Requests
- Once your feature or fix is ready, create a pull request against the `develop` branch.
- Describe your changes clearly and provide any relevant context or issue links.
- Maintainers will review your pull request and may suggest changes.

### Maintainers and Releases
- Releases are handled by project maintainers and are not part of the contributor workflow.

## Best Practices
- Commit messages should clearly describe the intent of your changes.
- Documentation should be updated as appropriate.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions already in place within the project.

## Community Contributions
- Feel free to submit bug fixes, new features, or improvements.
- If you want to work on something big, or potentially controversial, consider creating an issue for discussion first.

## Questions or Concerns?
If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. We appreciate your feedback and will do our best to assist you.

Once again, thank you for your contributions to AIConsole. Your work helps everyone who uses this project.
